# Theoretical underpinnings 


There has been substantial interest in recent years in the relationship between affect and workplace performances, especially with regards to workplace creativity (Shalley et al., 2004; Barsade & Gibson, 2007). Most of the work on affect and creativity has been done in the context of individuals, where, reflecting a larger trend in studies of affect and work-related performances, attention has been focused on individual’s dispositional affect (see James et al., 2004 for a review).

### Positive affect 
The dominant view is that there is a positive association between experiencing positive affect and creativity (Amabile et al., 2005; Barsade & Gibson, 2007). Meta-analyses on mood and creativity support the broad conclusion that positive affective enhances creativity (Baas et al., 2008; Davis, 2009). Positive affect is seen to enhance creativity primarily because it allows individuals to make connections between divergent materials, use broader categories, and see more associations among stimuli (Isen, 1987). More specifically, positive affect is thought to moderate and enhance the cognitive processes linked to creativity (e.g. George & Zhou, 2002; Madjar et al., 2002). Mood as information theory also posits that affective states can be interpreted as providing information or signals about situations that influences cognitive processing (George & Zhou, 2007; Schwarz & Clore, 2003).

### Negative affect 
The impact of negative affect on creativity represents more complexity and less consensus. There is evidence that under different conditions, negative affect can hinder creativity (Baas et al., 2008), have no effect (Grawitch et al., 2003) or help creativity (Zhou & George, 2001). De Dreu et al. (2008) suggest a dual pathway model to parse the complexities, where not only hedonic tone of mood states (i.e. positive vs negative) but also their activation (activating vs deactivating) need to be taken in account. Specifically when activating moods have a negative tone, they positively impacts creativity through increased persistence. In addition to negative affect, there is some limited evidence that emotional ambivalence, or the simultaneous experience of positive and negative emotions, allow individuals to better recognize unusual relationships between concepts and thus be more creative (Fong, 2006).

### Collective affect 
In recent years, there has been a nascent literature on collective affect and creativity. There studies validate and emphasize the existence of group or shared affect – that is, a group’s affective state that arises from the combinations of individual-level affective factors as well as group- or contextual-level factors that mold the affect experience of the group (Kelly & Barsade, 2001). These studies also show that positive group affect has a salient impact on creativity (Grawitch et al., 2003). Positive affect encourages groups to explore whereas negative affect suppresses exploration (Knight, 2013). They focus on understanding how affect becomes shared within groups through processes such as emotional contagion, where one individual’s affect can be transferred to others, so that group members share the same affective states (Barsade, 2002). Affect becomes shared through collective, coordinated activity that members engage in together (Totterdall, 2000), and collective affect is constructed through observable displays of inner affective states (Bartel & Saavedra, 2000). 

A key emergent insight is the reciprocal and dynamic nature of affect in groups, with several theoretical models of group affect and creativity incorporating a feedback mechanism to explain the role of affect (e.g. Kelly & Barsade, 2001; Walter & Bruch, 2008; Harvey, 2014). For example, Walter and Bruch (2008) proposed that positive affect in groups forms a self-reinforcing spiral with relationship quality; and Harvey (2014) proposed that enacting ideas and positive affect forms a feedback loop through a sense of progress. This suggests affect works in a circular, reciprocal way which is difficult to discretize and confine to stages. This is not surprising considering that it has shown that that affect and cognitions tended to form feedback loops (Izard et al., 1988) and that dynamic cycles of affect mirrors the creative process itself as being cycles rather than sequential stages (Lubart, 2001; Harrison & Rouse, 2014).

### Critique 
Most studies on the link between affect and creativity, across the literature on individual and groups, focus exclusively on the relationship between affect and idea generation (e.g. Kurtzberg, 2005; Grawitch et al., 2003; Rhee, 2006; Shin, 2014) and tell us little about how the role of affect in navigating ideas. This is important as different affective processes or states may facilitate different aspects of collective creativity. Perry-Smith and Coff (2011) suggest, for example, that different mood states support generation and selection of ideas, indicating that there are variances and nuances within the creative process despite general positive association. Notably missing in their model is an exploration of how affect might support idea navigation. 

In addition, majority of these studies are conducted in experimental settings where affect is artificially induced to focus on how affect move from individual-level to group level (Barsade & Gibson, 1998; Barsade, 2002), instead of examining the role of affect in-situ. While this allowed an examination of how affect becomes shared, it does not focus on its implications for creativity. Also, tasks in controlled experimental settings is marked different from doing creative work in context in terms of how personally meaningful and consequentually emotionally invested creators would be. Lastly, to understand the interpersonal effects of affect that occurs within groups requires us to take into account the nature of the situation which provides context (Van Kleef et al., 2010). Examing how affect arise organically during group interactions in context (George, 2008) will afford a focus on the role it plays in influencing idea development. As such, how affect shapes the process of idea navigation in groups is still an open question. 

### Qualitative studies 
A growing body of qualitative work on real groups in context is replete with examples and descriptions of groups engaging in activities intended to clarify, refine, build and integrate initial creative ideas. These works demonstrate the importance of interactional and situational dynamics of the groups in understanding how groups navigate ideas and provide some hints of a broader role of affect in this process.

### Communicate 
First, affect provides a method for groups members to communicate and share their responses to ideas. As groups navigate ideas, new insights and reframing of problems may occur and thus standards are likely to be emergent and evolving through the process. This may make it challenging for groups to communicate their perceptions of ideas using primarily cognitively-oriented expression. For example, in a study of modern dancers, Harrison and Rouse (2015) find that expressing emotional, visceral reactions that are explicitly subjective provided cues about how individuals responded to an idea. These emotional cues are seen as interchangeable with more cognitively oriented expressions and allowed individuals to communicate their interest or disinterest without having to fully specify the rationale behind them. These affectively-charged expressions formed part of a set of interactions that makes it possible for groups to explore the problem space in a flexible way. 

This example also suggests that communicating explicitly responses via affective cues or expressions (e.g. that’s cool, I like it, etc.) may be useful for navigating ideas because it dampens the fear of negative feedback. It has been shown that expectation of being evaluated or rated by experts who will "rate" or perform an "analysis" one's work decreased creativity. While more cognitive oriented statements (e.g. it's a bad idea) conveys judgment of quality against a set of criteria that can create anxiety and decrease willingness to share ideas, affective expressions can serve to highlight the subjectivity of the response or feedback. This allows group members to share ideas and give feedback with less fear of their ideas being evaluated as "bad". Existing research show that awareness and inducing of positive affect or limiting of negative affect is important in feedback interactions in the creative process, as positive affect motivates the receiver and encourages exploration (Zhou & George, 2003; Hargadon & Bechky, 2006). But in this case, expressing both positive and negative affective content seems to be useful as cues and allows groups to share their responses in the process of exploration (Harrison & Rouse, 2015).

### Move forward 
Second, affect may play a role in allowing groups to move forward with ideas when quality of ideas and outcomes are ambiguous. In order to develop ideas, groups need to converge around some initial ideas as worthy of further pursuit. This challenge is described by a designer in a study of creativity in modern dancers as follows: 
> “Often, after the brainstorming process is done, it’s difficult to pick the “best” idea to “run” with. Usually, a few strong directions emergence and picking a direction is a bit arbitrary. (Harrison & Rouse, 2015)

Some studies suggest that when groups are faced with highly ambiguous situations with uncertain outcomes, groups are able to converge around and engage with some ideas or problems, despite having different perspectives by letting shared affective states such as excitement or enthusiasm, rather than cognitive functions, drive the process (Majchrzak et al., 2012; Metiu & Rothbard, 2013). This view of affect as a way for groups to move forward in certain directions is in line with research on how in ambiguous situations, affect is an effective rather than dysfunctional pathway of making decisions (Huang & Pearce, 2015; Rivera, 2015).

For instance, Majchrzak et al. (2012) find that as members in cross functional teams spend more time in lengthy discourse they being to experience increasing anxiety and uncertainty about whether they will reach a solution and these experiences can lead to exhaustion or withdrawal. They avoid this by letting affect rather than cognition (e.g. evaluation) drive the process – converging around ideas members all show enthusiasm for and ignoring others. Similarly, Elsbach and Kramer (2003) showed that positive affect can used as an alternative mechanism to converge about the quality of an object where people hold different perspectives or standards. As such, groups can converge on ideas they share positive affect around, without necessarily verbalizing the rationale or being explicitly aligned in their perspectives. 

Finally, affect may facilitate idea navigation by influencing group motivation and energy. Harvey (2014) suggests that enacting ideas may enhance the perception that that things are progressing in a conceptually coherent way and groups tend to experience positive affect. This likely creates a feedback loop where the feeling of progress induces positive effect (Amabile & Kramer, 2011) and positive affect in turn encourages explorations and further enacting. 

### Energize 
In what Rouse (2018) terms “generative energy”, affective states such as excitement and engagement bring about a sense of energy and fluidity to the idea development process in groups. Positive group affective states and shared feelings of excitement are seen as driving forces to encourage creators to explore especially in situations where outcomes or quality of potential ideas are highly ambiguous (Gish et al., 2009; Lingo & O’Mahony, 2010). Positive affect is also crucial in providing generative energy and emotional support that allow creators to focus on engaging with the ideas and forging ahead, which helps them move past the frequent huddles of feeling stuck and uninspired in the creative process (Majchrzak et al., 2012; Perry-Smith & Mannucci, 2017; Rouse, 2018). 

For example, Metiu and Rothbard (2013) finds that shared positive affect sustained engagement while people were solving problems together and the joy of having solved the problem also gave them an energy boost to continue with their work. In this case, shared affect is seen both as an outcome and reinforcer of groups engagement with problems, echoing the emerging perspective in the affect and creativity literature that affect is dynamic and recursive (Kelly & Barsade, 2001). 

### Bias 
Studies such as those discussed above point to the importance of affect in facilitating idea navigation through the often long, tedious, and uncertain process of doing idea work (Gish et al., 2009), yet how affective processes develop within and interact with idea navigation is unclear. In particular, research on decision-making presents conflicting view of affect as bias. Emotional input to decisions such as how one feels about different courses of action can lead people to select a particular course of action even when cognitive information suggests otherwise (for a review see Loewenstein). Even affective states and information that are not relevant for the decision at hand are known to have carryover effects that influences judgement - these influences are seen as inherently biasing given that they are not integral to the decision-making (for a review see Lerner et al., 2015). These two perspectives being at odds indicates that it is still unclear how groups draw on affect in navigating ideas without inducing bias. [?? can i rly say this]

### RQ 
Thus, the present paper aims to systematically explore affect in group creative process; asking, in particularly, how does affect shape how groups navigate ideas.
